# Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Yerim, and through this blog, I aim to share my journey and experiences as I dive deeper into the world of development. I'll mostly be covering topics related to  React & Spring & AI . I'm passionate about IT and want to document my growth and learning process. ðŸ˜Š

## My Tech Journey ðŸŒ±

Ever since I was young, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by computers and technology. During college, I started to seriously get into development, majoring in Medical Engineering. Over time, Iâ€™ve learned various technologies and gained hands-on experience, which I found incredibly exciting. In the beginning, learning programming had its challenges, but looking back, the experience and skills Iâ€™ve gained are invaluable.

## My Tech Stack ðŸ”§

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on Java & Spring Framework & new Technology, and Iâ€™m working on projects to expand my knowledge. Iâ€™m also excited to dive deeper into new Technology and Java in the future. Through this blog, I hope to connect with others who share similar interests, and exchange ideas and knowledge!

## What I Hope to Achieve ðŸŽ¯

Through this blog, Iâ€™m looking forward to connecting with fellow developers, sharing experiences, and learning together. Please feel free to leave feedback or ask questionsâ€”let's learn and grow as a community!
